Add a front-end toolkit to the block editor that allows to change device visibility, mouse hover options, animations, convert into components and more...

== Description ==

Easily use [Mr.Utils](https://marcosrego.com/development/mr-utils/) front-end toolkit with the block editor interface without knowing code, the classes or the functions.

You can transform parent blocks (such as Columns or Groups) into components such as Tabs, Swiper or Sliders (with pagination).

You can select what to do when mouse hovering a block (e.g. animations or a semi-opacity).

You can also apply changes to specific devices/breakpoints: Show/hide blocks depending of the device, remove default margins/paddings, apply a global margin/padding, change font-size depending of device and more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/mrutils` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the interface of Mr.Utils support all blocks? =

Since version 0.2.0, that the interface of Mr.Utils works with all core blocks. For third-party blocks or if a specific block is not showing the "Utilities" section, you can still use the [utility classes](https://github.com/marcosrego-web/mr-utils/wiki/Utility-Classes) on the "Advanced" section > "Additional CSS class(es)". If a block is not working for you because of Mr.Utils, please [report the issue](https://github.com/marcosrego-web/mr-utils/issues) or [contact me](https://marcosrego.com/client-area/contact/), do let me know which block you are using.

== Screenshots ==

2. All options are divided into categories.
3. All options opened (except for breakpoints).
4. Example of options that will apply when mouse hovering a block.
5. Example of options that will only apply on phone devices.
6. Using Mr.Dev.'s Framework allows to select which options will be available (reducing HTTP requests and file size).
7. Mr.Dev.'s Framework allows to create custom utilities to select on the block editor.
