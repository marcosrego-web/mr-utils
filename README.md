# Mr.Utils

Utility classes and functions used by Mr.Dev.'s plugins, that you can also use on different environments.

A documentation is on the works, [check it on the wiki](https://github.com/marcosrego-web/mr-utils/wiki).

You can also install it as a [Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mr-utils/), to use all the features inside the block editor without knowing code, the classes or the functions.
